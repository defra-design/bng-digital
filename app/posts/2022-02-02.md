## Users and user needs 

When designing a government service (in this case the Biodiversity Net Gain register), the team start by learning about the [people who will use it](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs). ‘User needs’ are the needs that a user has of a service, and which that service must satisfy for the user to get the right outcome for them. 

Our user researchers have been busy in Alpha understanding and analysing user needs. They have conducted research with over 35 external users in Alpha so far to understand their motivations, goals, challenges and needs. This includes people from Local Planning Authorities, landowners, farmers, consultants and developers. 

Analysis of these interviews enabled us to create personas and identify requirements. Personas are based on real life users and pull together common goals, motivations and user needs. These needs are in the context of BNG’s evolving landscape and will be updated as our understanding develops.  

## How did we go about this? 

The team spoke to different users each fortnight (each sprint); the focus of our research was aligned to our sprint goal. During each interview they focus on contextual questions to get to know the user better, such as: 

* what they do in their role 
* how BNG has impacted their role 
* challenges that they face day to day 

During the same interview they walked through the register prototype and asked the users to complete a set of tasks. These tasks were representative of what they may need to do when using the real-life service. We observe the users completing tasks to help us understand how well the design was meeting the user needs.  We used these to update the prototype for the next round of research.  

From our interviews we have been able to extract common motivations, goals, challenges, and requirements. We have used this information to create draft personas as well as a list of prioritised user needs. We have used this information to help inform design decisions of the prototype. By understanding users we can assess how a change, to the design of the service, might impact different users.   

Image 1 below shows how we write user needs. These needs relate to ‘how users are getting ready for BNG delivery’ and represents some of the key challenges and needs users have when trying to prepare for BNG.

Image 2 below is our persona, Ethan. Ethan is a private ecologist who works with developers. It shows the types of challenges he faces, his main goals and his user needs. When we are designing and testing the register service, we can think about how this might help meet some of Ethan’s needs. This persona is based on research conducted with numerous ecologists and is an accumulation of the findings.

## What’s happening next?  

We will be continuing to ask questions and explore how we can best build these digital services to meet the needs of future users and legislation. We’re extremely grateful for everyone who has participated in user research so far and are looking forward to engaging with more of you soon.  

If you haven’t already expressed an interest in participating in the user research but would like to, please do let us know!
