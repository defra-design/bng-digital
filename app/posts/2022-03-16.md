## The past 2 weeks on the Biodiversity Gain Site Register Project

### Our Alpha Assessment

In our [previous post](https://bng-digital.herokuapp.com/2022-02-21) we spoke about getting ready for our Alpha Assessment, this was held on the 2nd March 2022.

A service assessment can be a daunting challenge, bringing together months of work to demonstrate to a panel of assessors within the [Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/central-digital-and-data-office), how we’re meeting the [GDS Service Standards](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), across user research, design, technology, and our ways of working.

The team did an amazing job at the assessment, and we’ve just received confirmation that we passed!

### Telling the story

Knowing that the assessors would only have a limited knowledge of our service. Going into the assessment, we started high level with a brief introduction to our service problem statement and vision, our users, and their journeys.  This set the scene for us to walk them through our latest prototype, showing the assessors the things, we’ve been working on.

As we talked through our work and answered the assessor’s questions, the key message we wanted to get across was how Alpha had been a journey of exploration and iteration for the team. Alpha has been a big learning curve for all of us, allowing us to take insights from Discovery and gradually start to validate, test, and refine ideas into something that could work.

### The Feedback

Some key things the assessors liked about our work:

* Our user-centred design approach, forming a comprehensive understand of our users, and working with policy teams to help solve problems
* Having a well-resourced and passionate team with the full range of skills
* Thorough investigation and research into technology options and measures of success for the service
* Working in the open, sharing knowledge with other teams, and regularly blogging about our work

In Beta, we’ll be  addressing the points identified by the assessors that need further exploration, particularly around making sure everyone can use the service, addressing accessibility and security challenges, and engaging with wider users such as the general public.

You can read the full feedback report on the [Service Standard Reports page](https://www.gov.uk/service-standard-reports) once it's published.

### Next steps

We are now planning for our Beta phase, reflecting on what we have learned in Alpha, reflecting on feedback from the assessment, and putting plans in place for what we do next.

In Beta we want to build and test basic versions of our service quickly, learning from what does and doesn’t work for users. To prepare for this we are reviewing our service design, forming our product backlog, and preparing the technology environment and infrastructure needed to start building. 



## Metric team Discovery

### User research latest

User research interviews with Local Planning Authorities, Consultants and Ecologists stared on the 21st February 2022.

#### Research objectives

A total of up to 35 research sessions are scheduled, this includes. the following user groups:

* Ecological consultants
* Local planning authorities
* Developers
* Habitat NGOs
* Defra internal staff (Policy and others)

Our objective is to understand:

* How we might improve the end-to-end process
* Review of metric spreadsheet usability
* Understand who is using the metric and what their needs are
* Understand how the metric is used in different projects
* Establish data entry requirements
* Understand what data presentation/ visualisation tools are required

We want to encourage participation from varying ethnicities, genders, accessibility needs, assisted digital and those with low digital skills.

#### Latest updates

Our two user researchers (Mark and Sam) have been analysing user needs. So far, we have completed two rounds of user research, . to date, 15 sessions have taken place. The focus of the first couple of rounds was Local Planning Authorities and Ecological Consultants.


### Other activities

Alignment with the other product teams is ongoing to ensure we understand how metric fits into the other workstreams such as Register and Credits and understand the overall customer journey and touchpoints.

In parallel we are reviewing accessibility findings, capturing stakeholder information, looking at associated tools (QGIS).


### What’s next for the Metric tool team?

Continuation of user research with 12 more sessions planned: 6 with Habitat NGOs and 6 with Developers.

We will be holding a mid-Discovery user research update session to share output, discuss user needs, personas, and user journeys.

There will also be a first project "show and tell" this week with stakeholder’s, giving them a general team update.
