## Hello! 

Since our last update, the team have been building an understanding of how a gain site location and area could be added to the Biodiversity Gain Site Register. The location and area of a biodiversity gain site is a specific data requirement of the Register, as set out in the [Environment Act](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2593). The [Discovery phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works) highlighted that our future users had their own needs for the location part of the Register, so we investigated further to understand the best way to capture location data. 

## How did we go about this?

We carried out a “How Might We” workshop to share ideas on how to collect accurate location and area data of a gain site consistently.    

Following this workshop, we explored various technical geospatial options; those employed by other government services as well as what is currently in use in Natural England.

Our Interaction Designer then built a prototype to help us test the options. We used the prototype with future users to gain their feedback and help us understand what would meet their needs. We will use this feedback to update the prototype so that we can conduct more research and prototype testing with future users.
