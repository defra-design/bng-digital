## Hello! 

Welcome to our first blog. We’re the Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) Digital Services Team in Natural England. 

We are developing the Biodiversity Gain Sites Register and Statutory Biodiversity Credit Sales Service, with an overarching service vision of advancing nature's recovery by supporting development to achieve lasting benefits for people, places, and the natural world. 

This is preparatory work Natural England has been asked to do by Defra ahead of the [introduction of mandatory Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVR9VZYkMLc) by the proposed [Environment Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2593).  

We’ll be using this blog to share our work with you. We’ll talk about what we’ve been doing and what we’ve learnt. Over time the blog will tell a story of how the project and services have developed. By talking about our work regularly we hope to better describe what it is we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and give you a chance to see it early on. As we’ve learnt from [Government’s Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles). 

> We should share what we’re doing whenever we can. With colleagues, with users, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service the better it gets - howlers are spotted, better alternatives are pointed out, the bar is raised. 

## What is BNG?

BNG is an approach to development, that leaves the environment in a measurably better state. It is additional to existing environmental protections. 

Whilst this blog will focus specifically on the Digital Services we are developing, they are just one component of mandatory BNG. Read our findings from the [BNG: updating planning requirements](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/biodiversity-net-gain-updating-planning-requirements) consultation. 

## What we’ve done so far 

![Stages of service design](/alpha-poster.jpeg)

The Digital Services project started in November 2020 by understanding what the services needed to do. We approached this by asking questions like: 
* What are the drivers for these services?
* What context do they sit within?
* Who are our stakeholders and users?

This helped us to form a picture of the current planning journey, the experience of our users and what the future may look like. Taking a user-centred design approach, we engaged the future users of the services, by holding interactive online workshops, and using digital collaboration tools, helping us to understand their needs. 

In March 2021, we used the outputs from the workshops to produce a Discovery Report. [Read a reflection on this phase in this blog post on the Defra Digital Blog](https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2021/06/22/giving-nature-a-digital-hand/). 

## Being Agile in Alpha 

We started the current phase of the project, [Alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works), in July 2021, with a focus on testing different solutions to the problem we had learnt about during Discovery. This is an exciting time, growing the team to bring in colleagues from Digital, Data and Technology Services (DDTS) and working to get the insights of our users. 

Taking an [agile approach](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-government-services-introduction), we’re working in sprints, focusing on specific tasks in short, time-boxed periods. We are producing prototypes and testing them with users, to find out what works and what doesn’t. Then, we'll refine and test them again, creating better and better user centred solutions. Its quick, iterative, and user-centred. As this work develops this blog communicate our findings, next steps and the emerging priorities. 

Come back soon to see what we’ve been up to!
